The files in this directory are generated based on the .fidl and .fdepl files in the [fidl folder](../fidl/). These codes are utilized to enable processes to engage in vsomeip communication as either a service or a client.

Take note of how these codes are included and used in the source code. Also, pay attention to their inclusion in the [CMakeLists.txt](../CMakeLists.txt).

If you want to understand the specifics of generating these codes, please refer to the [fidl folder](../fidl/).
